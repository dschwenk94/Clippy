## 📝 Current System Architecture

The uploaded version of Clippy uses the **ASS (Advanced SubStation Alpha)** caption system as the primary subtitle format, which provides:

- **Rich text formatting** with colors and effects
- **Speaker-specific colors** (Red/Orange for Speaker 1, Blue for Speaker 2, Green for Speaker 3)
- **Pop-out animation effects** for engaging captions
- **Viral word highlighting** in uppercase with special formatting

The SRT system is included as a fallback option but the main application uses ASS format.
