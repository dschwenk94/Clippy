## 🚀 Migration Steps

### 1. Backup Your Current Installation

```bash
# Create a backup of your current Clippy directory

```

### 5. Update Configuration

#### OAuth Setup (if using YouTube upload)
- Copy your existing `client_secrets.json` if you have one
- Delete old `token.pickle` to re-authenticate with new system

#### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
```

## 🔧 Breaking Changes

### 1. Caption System
- **Old**: Basic SRT-only captions
- **New**: ASS + SRT support with `ass_caption_update_system_v2.py`
- **Action**: No action needed - backward compatible

### 2. File Structure
- **New files added**:
  - `ass_caption_update_system_v2.py` - Fixed caption timing
  - `caption_fragment_fix.py` - Handles fragmented captions
  - `srt_viral_caption_system.py` - Enhanced SRT support

### 3. API Changes
The Flask routes have been updated:
- `/api/update_captions` - Now uses hybrid regeneration
- `/api/refresh_video` - New endpoint for video refresh
- `/api/oauth/*` - New OAuth endpoints

## 📝 New Configuration Options

### Caption Timing Settings
In `ass_caption_update_system_v2.py`:
```python
MIN_CAPTION_DURATION = 0.3      # Reduced from 0.8
MIN_GAP_BETWEEN_CAPTIONS = 0.05  # Reduced from 0.15
```

### Speaker Colors
Customizable in `auto_peak_viral_clipper.py`:
```python
self.speaker_colors = [
    "#FF4500",   # Speaker 1 - Fire Red/Orange
    "#00BFFF",   # Speaker 2 - Electric Blue  
    "#00FF88"    # Speaker 3 - Neon Green
]
```

## 🐛 Common Migration Issues

### Issue: "bad escape \c at position 1" error
**Solution**: Run the hotfix script:
```bash
python apply_caption_hotfix.py
```

### Issue: Captions out of sync
**Solution**: The timing system has been fixed. Regenerate your captions or run:
```bash
python apply_timing_fix.py
```

### Issue: Missing dependencies
**Solution**: Ensure you've installed all requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements_webapp.txt --upgrade
```
