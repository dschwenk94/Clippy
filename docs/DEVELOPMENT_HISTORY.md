# ðŸ“š Clippy Development History

## Overview
This document consolidates the development history and key decisions made during the evolution of Clippy.

## Caption System Evolution

### Version History
1. **v1-v5**: Various iterations with timing and synchronization issues
2. **v6 (Current)**: ASS Caption Update System V6 - Speech Sync
   - Perfect synchronization with original speech timing
   - Multi-speaker support with color coding
   - Phrase-by-phrase caption display
   - Viral word highlighting

### Key Features
- Uses ASS (Advanced SubStation Alpha) format for rich styling
- Maintains original transcription timing from Whisper
- Supports up to 3 speakers with distinct colors
- Automatic caption positioning and styling

## Repository Organization

### Major Cleanups
1. **Version Consolidation**: Removed v1, v2, v3 file variants
2. **Documentation Organization**: Moved all docs to `/docs/` directory
3. **Script Organization**: Utility scripts moved to `/scripts/`
4. **JavaScript Cleanup**: Archived older versions to `/static/js_archive/`

### Current Architecture
- **Main Application**: `app.py` (Flask + SocketIO)
- **Caption System**: `ass_caption_update_system_v6.py`
- **Video Processing**: `viral_clipper_complete.py`
- **Peak Detection**: `enhanced_heuristic_peak_detector.py`
- **Multi-User Support**: Full OAuth integration with PostgreSQL

## Key Decisions

1. **Multi-User Architecture**: Implemented to support multiple users with individual Google accounts
2. **Anonymous Support**: Added ability to generate clips without authentication
3. **TikTok Integration**: Extended platform support beyond YouTube
4. **ASS Format**: Chosen for rich styling capabilities and timing precision

## Future Considerations
- Additional platform integrations
- Enhanced peak detection algorithms
- Real-time collaboration features
