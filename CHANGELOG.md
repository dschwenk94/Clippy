## [2.0.0] - 2025-06-06

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Release - Multi-User Support

This release transforms Clippy into a multi-user application with individual authentication and isolated workspaces.

### Added
- **Multi-User Authentication**: Google OAuth integration for individual user accounts
- **PostgreSQL Database**: User management, session tracking, and upload history
- **Per-User YouTube Integration**: Each user connects their own YouTube account
- **Upload History**: Track all uploads per user with timestamps and metadata
- **Secure Session Management**: 7-day sessions with encrypted tokens
- **User Isolation**: Complete separation of jobs, clips, and uploads between users
- **Beta Testing System**: Controlled access during development phase

### Changed
- Default app is now `app_multiuser.py` (single-user version preserved as `app.py`)
- OAuth scopes expanded to include user profile information
- WebSocket rooms now user-specific for isolated real-time updates
- File structure reorganized with new `auth/` and `database/` modules

### Security
- All OAuth tokens encrypted using Fernet symmetric encryption
- Database credentials stored in environment variables
- Session tokens use cryptographically secure random generation
- CSRF protection in OAuth flow

### Technical Details
- New dependencies: `psycopg2-binary`, `python-dotenv`
- Database schema: `users`, `upload_history`, `user_sessions` tables
- Migration system for database updates
- Comprehensive error handling for OAuth flows

### Notes
- Beta access required (contact @dschwenk94 for access)
- PostgreSQL required for multi-user mode
- Single-user version remains available for simpler deployments
